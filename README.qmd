# geoarrowrs

`{geoarrowrs}` provides R bindings to the geoarrow-rs Rust crate. They are in a very early stage. 

Right now file readers for flatgeobuf, geojson, and shapefiles have been implemented. GeoParquet reader is on the near horizon. Afterwards the geoarrow algorithms and spatial indices will be implemented.

## Usage

The flatgeobuf reader is approximately 4 times faster than `sf` in this use case. 

```{r}
library(geoarrow)
library(geoarrowrs)

# get the file path
fp <- system.file("extdata", "osm-edinburgh-central.fgb", package = "geoarrowrs")

# read the flatgeobuf file
stream <- read_flatgeobuf_(fp)
stream

# convert to a record batch reader
reader <- arrow::as_record_batch_reader(stream)
reader 

# convert to sf 
sf::st_as_sf(reader) |> 
    dplyr::glimpse()
```
